OnionCheck is a program for monitoring closed onion-pages. The fact is that on the Darknet, most of the sites 
are either dead or open only for a while. The reasons are different: maybe the owner does not have money for 
permanent hosting, or he wants to let only a narrow community of trusted people into his page... 
In any case, when a netstalker finds a suspicious site that is closed at the moment, our tool will help him/her
to automatically track the activity of the page and understand if this site is really as dead as it seems.

Usage

Just launch Tor browser(!), add any url addresses in the 'Settings' section and click 'Start' in main menu. 
You can also click 'Edit_Schedule' to set frequency to adjust the frequency with which the program will check the status of sites.
The entire chronicle of the work of each site will be recorded in a 'results.txt' file. You can let this program work for a few days
and then see it's report. Don't forget that the Tor browser must be working as well.

Telegram Bot

If you want to receive notifications each time when program detects an active site, 
click 'Set up a telegram bot' in main menu. You will need to create a bot with @BotFather 
in telegram and give the program it's access token and your telegram id (use @getmyid_bot to get it).
Then you can check if your bot is connected with 'Check_for_a_bot' option.
